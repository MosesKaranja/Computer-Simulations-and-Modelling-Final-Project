Exploring Health Systems
There are always these questions in the health sector: What is the best way to run a national health system? Does spending more always lead to better results, or does it matter who spends the money and where it goes? 

By exploring the World Bank data to see which countries spend the highest amounts of their money on their healthcare one may compare spending vz the health indicators or outcome of that country. Of course there is more than one way to spend money on healthcare. Governments often spend most of the money, but people also spend out of pocket money.

Use KNN modelling techniques to categorize the countries which are higher and lower spenders. Give a visualization of your data and categorization result. The exercise is to be done using Python libraries. 

The code used must be clearly documented. 

Hint: You can convert your dataset into categories for easy analysis/classification
